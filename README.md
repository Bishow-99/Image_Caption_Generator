# Image_Caption_Generator
In this project, I have used pretrained Model VGG19 for extracting the features from the more than 8k images. Moreover,I have used LSTM and NLP to predict the caption for the images . The dataset I have used in this project is Flickr8k dataset which was downloaded from the Kaggle.
